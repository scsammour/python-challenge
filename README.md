# python-challenge
Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.


Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.



Py Bank
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
